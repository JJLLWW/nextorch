What This Is 
=============

Welcome to NEXTorch! This is an open-source software package in Python/PyTorch to faciliate experimental design using Bayesian Optimization (BO). 
NEXTorch is also a library for learning the theory and implementation of BO. 


Why We Built This
==================

Data generation in chemical science can be expensive and time-consuming for both computational modeling and physical experiments performed in the lab. 
Chemical systems are often complex, multidimensional with various interacting parameters, making optimization and predictive modeling challenging. 
Design of experiments (DoE) such as factorial and response surface designs has been employed to determine the relationships between input parameters and output responses. However, the traditional DoE is static in nature, hindering its applications in capturing interactions and fine-tuning parameters in high dimensional spaces.
